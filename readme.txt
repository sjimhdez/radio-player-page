A simple audio player for WordPress, rendering a fully standalone app in a clean, dedicated page.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to configure a specific WordPress page to display a clean, standalone audio player powered by a reactive app.

It is intended for minimal radio playback use cases, where a full WordPress layout is unnecessary or undesirable.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Go to **Settings > Radio Player Page Settings**
4. Set your stream URL and choose the page where the player will render

== Technical Notes ==

This plugin outputs a fully custom HTML document and intentionally exits the WordPress execution flow early via `exit` in the `template_redirect` hook. This is done to provide a minimal and fully decoupled player environment, free from the WordPress theme or layout.

As a result:
- WordPress actions and filters that normally load scripts and styles (including `wp_enqueue_script()` and `wp_enqueue_style()`) are never reached.
- Any enqueued assets would be ignored, and using the enqueue system would be misleading and redundant.
- The plugin directly includes only the specific compiled files needed (based on the Vite manifest) inside the generated HTML document.

This behavior is intentional and documented both in this file and in the source code (`radio-player-page.php`), as itâ€™s critical to the design goal of serving a clean standalone player.

The code respects all other WordPress standards and security practices, but skips the enqueue mechanism by necessity.

== Source Code ==
